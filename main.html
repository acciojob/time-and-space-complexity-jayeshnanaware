	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is understood as the time taken by a program to run and complete the give task .As a programmer ,your goal to reduce time complexity  of the code  by optimizing it by making iy more efficient.</p>
	<p><b>Time Complexity</b> is a related to the  amount of memory  occupied by the  program. fpr example if a program takes an array of size n , the space complexity of program becomes O(n).</p>
